Model Analysis ToolKit (MATK) - Python toolkit for model analysis
=================================================================

Homepage: http://matk.lanl.gov

MATK facilitates model analysis within the Python computational environment.
MATK expects a *model* defined as a Python function that accepts a dictionary of parameter values as the first argument and returns model results as a dictionary, array, integer, or float. 
Many model analyses are provided by MATK.
These model analyses can be easily modified and/or extended within the Python scripting languange.
New model analyses can easily be hooked up to a MATK model as well.
